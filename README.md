# SD Webui Middleware

A plugin that allows hot loading middleware into the webui. 
Very useful for developers, as reloading in the webui is not easy.
This will reload your middleware every time it runs so it is easy to develop and share
middleware. 

Check extgension for an example. Select Middleware from the script dropdown to run it.
